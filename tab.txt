<b>Bb</b>
   I got my driver’s license last week
                             <b>Gm</b>
Just like we always talked about

Cause you were so excited for me
                             <b>Eb</b>
To finally drive up to your house

But today I drove through the suburbs
                            <b>Bb</b>
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl

Who always made me doubt
<b>Gm</b>
   She's so much older than me
                                 
She's everything I'm insecure about
         <b>Eb</b>
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
                                 <b>Bb</b>
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Refrão]

    <b>Eb</b>                 <b>F</b>
And I know we weren't perfect
          <b>Gm</b>              <b>Eb</b>      <b>Bb</b>
But I've never felt this way for no one
    <b>Eb</b>             <b>F</b>              <b>Gm</b>           <b>Eb</b>
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay
         <b>Bb</b>
Now that I'm gone

       <b>Gm</b>         <b>F</b>              <b>Bb</b>
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote 
         <b>Dm</b>    <b>Eb</b>
In that song about me
 
Cause you said forever
    <b>F</b>                   <b>Bb</b>
Now I drive alone past your street

[Segunda Parte]

<b>Bb</b>
   And all my friends are tired
                                 
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
<b>Gm</b>
   I kinda feel sorry for them
                                             
Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
   <b>Eb</b>
Today I drove through the suburbs
                            <b>Bb</b>
And pictured I was driving home to you

[Refrão]

    <b>Eb</b>                 <b>F</b>
And I know we weren't perfect
          <b>Gm</b>              <b>Eb</b>      <b>Bb</b>
But I've never felt this way for no one
    <b>Eb</b>             <b>F</b>              <b>Gm</b>           <b>Eb</b>

Now I drive alone past your street

[Ponte]

 <b>Gm</b>
Red lights, stop signs
                               <b>Eb</b>
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
 <b>F</b>                             <b>Gm</b>
Can't drive past the places we used to, go to
      
      <b>Eb</b>                         <b>Bb</b>
Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe
                <b>F</b>
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh

 <b>Gm</b>
Sidewalks we crossed
<b>F</b>                                <b>Eb</b>
I still hear your voice in the traffic
               <b>F</b>          
We're laughing over all the noise
         <b>Gm</b>
God I'm so blue, know we're through
    <b>Eb</b>                         <b>Bb</b>
But I still fuckin' love you, babe
                <b>F</b>
Ooh oh oh oh oh oh

    <b>Eb</b>                 <b>F</b>
